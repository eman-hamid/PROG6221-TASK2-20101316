Changed Task 1 : Task2 POE 

I have implemented error handling to task one as well as added it to task two.
I have changed fields for a home loan and renting, there are now two different fields.
I have changed the calculations for home loan, a new calculation is used to find out home loan repayment. 
I have now also implemented inheritance.
As well as used more than one form to show different sections in the app.
I have added more classes in this task as well.
I have added a generic collection instead of an array the store to expenses. 
I have also added better comments to the program to run smoothly.
The readme file has more well explained logic about the app. So it is easy for the user to understand.
